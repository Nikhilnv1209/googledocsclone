Thc clone Consisits of 4 components:
1. header:- This is the Component that is used to render the header of the clone containing the 
            logo, title of the doc which is editable and other controls.
            the header components have static icons and links

2. Texteditor:- This is the Component that is used to render the editor of the clone containing the 
            editable text area and the controls for the text area.
            Here i had used REACT QUILL text editor Package to implement the text editor.

3. Sidebar:- This is the Component that is used to render the sidebar of the clone containing the
            links to other google apps as told to do.

4. EditorToolbar - contains the controls for the text editor like bold, italic, underline, etc.
            it is used as the default configuration of QUILL text editor doesn't provide all the controls
            hence extra controls are added using this component.

            since REACT QUILL have it's own css so the above component is used in the same way according 
            to the css of the REACT QUILL.



5. Toolbaroptions - contains the actual configuration of all the components including the undo and redo
            buttons.

                css for the html,body and root id.
